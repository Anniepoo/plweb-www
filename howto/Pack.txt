---+ Creating and submitting extension packages for SWI-Prolog

[[alert.gif]] There is a typo in the server address of the package
server in SWI-Prolog 6.1.4.  To fix this, edit library(prolog_pack),
line 81 and replace =|www.prolog.org|= with =|www.swi-prolog.org|=.
You can edit this file using

  ==
  ?- edit(library(prolog_pack)).
  ==


---++ What is a pack?

A pack is an archive (.zip or .tgz) file that (minimally) contains,
two items:

  $ A subdirectory =prolog= :
  If the pack is installed, this directory is added to the Prolog
  library.  This directory contains Prolog files using the extension
  =|.pl|=.

  $ A file =|pack.pl|= :
  This file provides [[meta-data][PackInfo.txt]] for the pack.

---++ Creating a pack

A pack is created by creating the a directory with the name of the pack
and filling it with the content described above. Next, create an
archive, which is either a _|gzipped tar|_ file or a _zip_ file from the
file that must be named <pack>-<version>.tgz or <pack>-<version>.zip,
where version is a list of digits, separated by dots (.).  For example:

  ==
  % tar zcvf mypack-1.0.tgz mypack
  ==

or

  ==
  % zip -r mypack-1.0.zip mypack
  ==

---++ Test the pack

The pack may be installed using pack_install/1 as illustrated below.

  ==
  ?- pack_install('mypack-1.0.tgz').
  ==

---++ Make the pack available

To make the pack available, it must be downloadable from a publicably
available HTTP server. To support package upgrading, the HTTP server
must have enabled fetching an index of the directory. I.e., if the pack
is located at http://www.exmmple.com/swi-prolog/pack/mypack-1.0.tgz,
fetching http://www.exmmple.com/swi-prolog/pack/ must return an HTML
document with links to available package files.

After uploaded the package to e.g.,
http://www.exmmple.com/swi-prolog/pack/mypack-1.0.tgz, it is made
available to other users simply by installing it yourself:

  ==
  ?- pack_install('http://www.exmmple.com/swi-prolog/pack/mypack-1.0.tgz').
  ==

After this, other people can install your package simply using

  ==
  ?- pack_install(mypack).
  ==

---++ Do's and Don'ts

To make packages work smoothly, package submitters need to take care
of some rules:

  - Use a meaningful name for your package that is not likely to
    conflict.  Check http://www.swi-prolog.org/pack/list to verify
    there is no name conflict.

  - All files in the =prolog= directory *must* be Prolog module files.
    Use names for the module files that are not likely to conflict with
    others.

  - Use consistent version numbers (e.g. 0.1, 0.2 ..., 1.0).  Versions
    are compared by turning the version id into a list of integers that
    is compared using compare/3.  Make sure that the version in
    =|pack.pl|= matches the version encoded in the archive name.
