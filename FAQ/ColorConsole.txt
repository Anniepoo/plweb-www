---+ Get colored output on the command line

Currently, SWI-Prolog support colored messages on the command line by loading
library(ansi_term).  This requires a terminal devices that understand ANSI
color escape sequences (\e[...m).  Almost all modern terminal emulators
support this.  It is also supported by the Windows console application
(swipl.exe).  The feature is activated simply by loading the mentioned
library.  You may add the following snippit to your personal init file:

  ==
  :- (   stream_property(user_output, tty(true))
     ->  load_files(library(ansi_term), [silent(true)])
     ;   true
     ).

@bug The Windows GUI console (swipl-win.exe) does not yet support color.
@see PlInitialisation.txt for editing your personal init file.
