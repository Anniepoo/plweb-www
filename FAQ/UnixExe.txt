---+ Creating executables on Unix/Linux

Creating an executable that runs on the computer on which Prolog is installed is rather simple.  Below, we create =myexe= from =|file.pl|= and make it execute
hello/0.  The contents of hello.pl is given below

  ==
  % swipl -o myexe -g hello -c hello.pl
  % ./myexe
  Hello world!
  ==

---+++ hello.pl

  ==
  hello :-
      format('Hello world!~n'),
      halt.
