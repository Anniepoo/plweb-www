---+ Creating a Windows console application from SWI-Prolog

If you want to use a SWI-Prolog program as a stand-alone *|.exe|*, you can
do this using qsave_program/2 or using the commandline. The command
below creates =|myapp.exe|= from =load.pl= and makes the program start at
main/0

==
swipl.exe -o myapp.exe -c load.pl --goal=main
==

To run, =|myapp.exe|= requires =|libswipl.dll|= and any other dll it uses through
libraries to be in the same directory or in %PATH%.

@see In many cases, it is way easier to start an application [from the Prolog source](<PrologScript.html>).
