---+ SWI-Prolog on Linux distributions

SWI-Prolog is a package on most major Linux distributions.  This page tells
you about the status of SWI-Prolog on your distro and helps you to build
SWI-Prolog from source on your distro.

Packaging varies enormously between Linux distributions.  We established
some [[guidelines][guidelines.txt]] in the hope to help streamlining this.

---++ Finding and checking the package

On most systems a search for _swi_ or _prolog_ should suffice to find the
SWI-Prolog package.  The development platform is often packaged seperately.
Make sure you have this.  You can check this using e.g., the commands
below in and X11-enabled (graphical) environment.  This should open a
new window with the built-in Emacs clone.
