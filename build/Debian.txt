---++ Status

Debian Squeeze and derived distributions come with a properly packaged but old (version 5.10.4) SWI-Prolog.  We advice to compile the sources on older Debian derived distros or you need a fairly recent version.

---++ PPA (Ubuntu Personal Package Archive)

There are PPAs for [SWI-Prolog stable](https://launchpad.net/~swi-prolog/+archive/stable) and [SWI-Prolog development](https://launchpad.net/~swi-prolog/+archive/devel) based on the official Debian packaging structure and corresponding SWI-Prolog release.  This PPA version can be installed using the commands below in Ubuntu 12.04 and 13.04:

These PPAs are updated with every new release.  Thanks to Yves Raimond for setting up the PPA snd Eugeniy Meshcheryakov for creating the Debian configuration.  The PPA is registered using `apt-add-repository`, which is by default available on desktops, but not on servers or Linux containers.  It is installed using:

  ==
  % sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
  ==

---+++ Stable versions

  ==
  % sudo apt-add-repository ppa:swi-prolog/stable
  % sudo apt-get update
  % sudo apt-get install swi-prolog

---+++ Development versions

  ==
  % sudo apt-add-repository ppa:swi-prolog/devel
  % sudo apt-get update
  % sudo apt-get install swi-prolog

---++ Dependencies

Use the following commands to obtain all dependencies for a full build
from source. Note that there are no known version dependencies on any of
these packages.  If your (debian-based) distribution is lacking any of
these package use =|apt-cache search <name>|= to find an alternative,
where <name> is e.g., =libunwind= (i.e., remove version and details).
Some remarks:

  - It is possible to use =iodbc= instead of =unixodbc= for ODBC
    connectivity.
  - The SWI-Prolog Java interface (JPL) works with many Java development
    kits, not only =|openjdk-7-jdk|=.
  - The package =|libarchive-dev|= is needed as of 6.1.4 for libarchive,
    which is needed by pack_install/1.
  - The package =|libossp-uuid-dev|= is needed as of 6.3.4 for
    library(uuid), which is needed for ClioPatria's SPARQL engine.

Note that older Debian based distributions, including the Debian
stable *|(Squeeze (6.0))|* ship with =|libunwind7-dev|= instead of
=|libunwind8-dev|=.


---+++ Dependencies to build the documentation

The generated documentation is included the source archives and downloaded by the =prepare= script when installing from the git source.  To rebuild the documentation, the following packages are needed.  Check =|man/README|= for
