---++ Status

Debian Squeeze and derived distributions come with a properly
packaged SWI-Prolog.  We advice to compile the sources on older
releases.

---++ Dependencies

Use the following commands to obtain all dependencies for a full build
from source. Note that there are no known version dependencies on any of
these packages.  If your (debian-based) distribution is lacking any of
these package use =|apt-cache search <name>|= to find an alternative,
where <name> is e.g., =libunwind= (e.i., remove version and details).

It is possible to use =iodbc= instead of =unixodbc= for ODBC connectivity.
The SWI-Prolog Java interface (JPL) works with most Java development kits,
not only =|openjdk-7-jdk|=.  =|libarchive-dev|= is needed as of 6.1.4.
=|libossp-uuid-dev|= is needed as of 6.3.4.
