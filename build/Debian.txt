# Prerequisites for Debian based systems (Ubuntu, Mint, ...)

Use the following commands to obtain all dependencies for a full build
from source. Note that there are no known version dependencies on any of
these packages.  If your (debian-based) distribution is lacking any of
these package use =|apt-cache search <name>|= to find an alternative,
where <name> is e.g., =libunwind= (i.e., remove version and details).
Some remarks:

  - It is possible to use =iodbc= instead of =unixodbc= for ODBC
    connectivity.
  - The SWI-Prolog Java interface (JPL) works with many Java development
    kits, not only =|openjdk-8-jdk|=.
  - The package =|libarchive-dev|= is needed as of 6.1.4 for libarchive,
    which is needed by pack_install/1.
  - The package =|libossp-uuid-dev|= is needed as of 6.3.4 for
    library(uuid), which is needed for ClioPatria's SPARQL engine.
  - The package =|libdb-dev|= is needed as of 7.3.8 for
    library(bdb), the BerkeleyDB embedded database interface.
  - The package =|libreadline-dev|= and =|libedit-dev|= both provide
    command line editing for interactive usage.  None is strictly
    needed and one of them suffices. =|libedit-dev|= is supported as of
    7.3.34 and is intended to become the preferred command line editor.
  - =libunwind= only simplifies debugging in case of a system crash.

Note that older Debian based distributions, including the Debian
stable *|(Squeeze (6.0))|* ship with =|libunwind7-dev|= instead of
=|libunwind-dev|=.

[Raspbian](<Raspbian.txt>) does not have =libunwind=. Just leave it out.
All other packages are available. SWI-Prolog versions 7.3.x require
*|gcc 4.8 or later|*, provided by Raspbian GNU/Linux 8.0 (jessie). Total
build time on a Raspberry pi model 2, including all packages is 22
minutes. If you want to reduce resources, the following packages are
optional:

  $ openjdk-8-jdk junit :
  Without you do not have Java connectivity (JPL)
  $ libxext-dev libice-dev libjpeg-dev libxinerama-dev libxft-dev libxpm-dev libxt-dev :
  If you leave these out, add =xpce= to =DISABLE_PKGS= in =build=. Means
  you have no graphics, no graphical development tools and no regular
  expression support.
  $ unixodbc-dev :
  Without, you have no ODBC database connectivity (e.g., MySQL)
  $ libssl-dev :
  Without, you have no SSL (and HTTPS) support.
  $ libgmp-dev :
  Without, you lack unbounded integer support, rational numbers, good
  random number generators, etc.
  $ libpcre3-dev :
  Without, you have no regular expression support (library(pcre)).

Note that including GMP support makes the memory footprint bigger, but
mostly if you have no other applications depending on GMP. All the other
optional components are only loaded if you actually use them.


### Prerequisites to build the documentation

The generated documentation is included the source archives and downloaded by the =prepare= script when installing from the git source.  To rebuild the documentation, the following packages are needed.  Check =|man/README|= for
further instructions.

==
sudo apt-get install \
	texlive-latex-extra \
	texlive-fonts-extra \
	texlive-fonts-extra-doc \
	texlive-fonts-recommended \
	texlive-fonts-recommended-doc

Now tht you've installed dependencies, return to [Build SWI-Prolog from source](<unix.html>) to complete installation.
