---+ Building SWI-Prolog for MS-Windows using MinGW

The [[MinGW][http://www.mingw.org]] compiler suite is a port of GCC that
targets the Windows platform. Unlike Cygwin which comes with an
extensive POSIX runtime emulation, MinGW targets the native Windows API
including MSVCRT (The MSVC runtime library that provides some POSIX
capabilities).

MinGW is distributed as a cross-compiler for many Linux distributions
and can be used under MSYS, _|"a collection of GNU utilities such as
bash, make, gawk and grep to allow building of applications and programs
which depend on traditionally UNIX tools to be present. It is intended
to supplement MinGW and the deficiencies of the cmd shell."|_.

The details for building SWI-Prolog for MS-Windows under Linux are
documented in the executable readme file =|README.mingw|= of the
source distribution. These scripts have been developed on 64-bit
[[Ubuntu][http://www.ubuntu.com/]] 12.04 and are currently used
for building the binary releases on Ubuntu 13.10.

We currently do not have experience building SWI-Prolog using MinGW/MSYS
on Windows. It is probably possible using the instructions in the above
mentioned =|README.mingw|= file. Please send comment and or fixes if
you try this. Note that cross compiling is much faster because
SWI-Prolog depends on an extensive =configure= script that executes slow
on the MSYS bash implementation.
