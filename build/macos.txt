---+ Building SWI-Prolog on MacOS (Lion and Snow Lion)

_Last updated: June 17, 2013, homebrew_

---++ Using Macports

Building SWI-Prolog for MacOS requires
[[Macports][http://www.macports.org/]]. In general, the Portfiles are
kept nicely up-to-date thanks to Paulo Moura.  If you are a Macport
user, SWI-Prolog can be installed simply using one of the commands
below.  The first installs the `stable' version and the second the
`development' version.  Note that most of the time developers are
better of using the development version.

  ==
  port install swi-prolog
  port install swi-prolog-devel
  ==

If you like to keep nice and lean system (i.e., if you do not want
Macports copies of X11, ODBC, etc), you still need to install several
prerequisites.  First:

  1. Xcode (can be installed as a free app from the appstore)
  2. Macports (download from http://www.macports.org/)
  3. X11.  This is an OS option for Lion (10.7) and must be installed
     from http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/ for Mountain Lion
     (10.8).

Next, you must install the following Macport libraries:

  ==
  port install gmp jpeg libarchive libiconv libmcrypt ncurses \
               openssl ossp-uuid pkgconfig readline zlib pcre libedit
  ==

Next, you can download SWI-Prolog as a [[source
archive][</Download.html>]] or using [[GIT][</git.html>]].  If you downloaded
using GIT you must _prepare_ the sources.  If you downloaded the source
archive theses steps are not needed (and in fact fail).  Preparing the GIT
source requires GNU `autoconf` from Macpors:

  ==
  port install autoconf
  ==

Next, _prepare_ by running the `prepare` script.  Omit the =|--yes|= if you
want a non-default installation.

  ==
  ./prepare --yes
  ==

From here, the source archive and GIT alternatives are united.  You can
build SWI-Prolog and all packages using the =build= script as follows:

  ==
  cp build.templ build
  <edit build, following comments>
  ./build
  ==

---++ Using Homebrew

[Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/) provides an alternative to Macports.
The command below installs the latest _stable_ version of SWI-Prolog:

  ==
  brew install swi-prolog
  ==

The latest git version of SWI-Prolog can be installed with this command:

  ==
  brew install swi-prolog --HEAD
  ==
