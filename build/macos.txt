---+ Building SWI-Prolog on MacOS (Lion and Snow Lion)

Last updated: Nov 2, 2012, SWI-Prolog 6.3.

Building SWI-Prolog for MacOS requires
[[Macports][http://www.macports.org/]]. In general, the Portfiles are
kept nicely up-to-date thanks to Paulo Moura.  If you are a Macport
user, SWI-Prolog can be installed simply using one of the commands
below.  The first installs the `stable' version and the second the
`development' version.  Note that most of the time developers are
better of using the development version.

  ==
  port install swi-prolog
  port install swi-prolog-devel
  ==

If you like to keep nice and lean system (i.e., if you do not want
Macports copies of X11, ODBC, etc), you still need to install several
prerequisites.  First:

  1. Xcode (can be installed as a free app from the appstore)
  2. Macports (download from http://www.macports.org/)
  3. X11.  This is an OS option for Lion (10.7) and must be installed
     from http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/ for Mountain Lion
     (10.8).

Next, you must install the following Macport libraries:

  ==
  port install gmp jpeg libarchive libiconv libmcrypt ncurses \
               openssl ossp-uuid pkgconfig readline zlib
  ==

Next, you can download SWI-Prolog as a [[source
archive][</Download.html>]] or using [[GIT][</git.html>]] and build it
using the =build= script as follows:

  ==
  cp build.templ build
  <edit build, following comments>
  ./build
  ==

@see The [[Portfile][<Portfile>]]
@see The scripts for building a binary release as distributed through
     our download pages are available in a git repository.  Use

     ==
     git clone git://www.swi-prolog.org/home/pl/git/misc/macos-build.git
