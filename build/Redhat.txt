The above is tested on Fedora 23. On Fedora < 23 the library for UUID
support was called `libossp-uuid-devel`. On Fedora < 21 the library for
JDT support was called `java-1.7.0-openjdk-devel'.

---++ Building the RPM

  1. Setup RPM build environment (according to
  [[CreatingPackageHowTo][http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/PackageMaintainers/CreatingPackageHowTo]])

    ==
    % sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
    % sudo yum install rpmdevtools
    % rpmdev-setuptree
    ==

  2. Download from the [[Project page][http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=3471]]

    ==
    % rpm -ihv --nomd5 https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//packages/pl/7.2.3/3.fc25/src/pl-7.2.3-3.fc25.src.rpm
    ==

  3. Install development libraries needed to compile SWI-Prolog

    ==
    % cd ~/rpmbuild
    % su
    % sudo yum install java-1.6.0-openjdk-devel
    % sudo yum install `grep ^BuildRequires SPECS/pl.spec | awk 'NF==2 {print $2}'`
    ==

  4. Build SWI-Prolog

    ==
    % rpmbuild -ba SPECS/pl.spec
    ==

On RHEL 5 it may become necessary to disable SELinux temporarily to
build the RPM because the built library libswipl.so requires text
relocation.
