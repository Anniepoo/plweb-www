---+ SWI-Prolog Wiki facilities

The underlying datastructure of this website consists mostly of
[[PlDoc][</pldoc/package/pldoc.html>]] Wiki documentation pages. Since
Mar 2, 2011, these pages can be edited through a web-interface.  Editing
is still quite immature.  This page describes the process.

First of all, you need an *account*.  You can get this by filling out
the [[registration form][</register>]].

With an account, click the [[edit.gif;height="15px"][<>]] button to open
the page in edit-mode. Make your changes, add a commit summary message
and optionally a more extensive comment.  Please respect the
[[wiki
notation][</pldoc/doc_for?object=section(2,'7',swi('/doc/packages/pldoc.html'))>]].

To create a *|new file|*, reference a =|.txt|= file and click the
created link. The link colors red and becomes underlined if the
pointer is positioned on the link.
