---+ SWI-Prolog Wiki facilities

The underlying datastructure of this website consists mostly of
[[PlDoc][</pldoc/package/pldoc.html>]] Wiki documentation pages. The PlDoc wiki format largely based on the _markdown_ dialect used by [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/markdown.html). Since
Mar 2, 2011, these pages can be edited through a web-interface.  Editing
is still quite immature.  This page describes the process.

To edit the wiki pages, you need to login to the site using your Google, Yahoo
or other OpenID account.  Please using the _login_ link in the top-left corner
of this page.  Next, you can ask for permission to edit the wiki pages using
[this link](</register>).

After being granted permission to edit the wiki pages, click the [[edit.gif;height="15px"][<>]] button to open
the page in edit-mode. Make your changes, add a commit summary message
and optionally a more extensive comment.  Please respect the
[wiki notation](</pldoc/man?section=wiki>).

To create a *|new file|*, reference a =|.txt|= file and click the
created link. The link colors red and becomes underlined if the
pointer is positioned on the link.
