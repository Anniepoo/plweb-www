---+ Accessing SWI-Prolog source via GIT

---++ If you need GIT

[[GIT][<git:>]] is a fast version control system developed by Linus
Torvalds and currently maintained by Junio C Hamano. Here is our
[[motivation][whygit.txt]] for choosing GIT for managing the SWI-Prolog
sources. You should use the GIT version if you want to stay
*|up-to-date|* and/or you want to
[[contribute][<howto/SubmitPatch.html>]] to the project. Many
professional users opt for this route.

First install [[GIT][<git:>]] for your platform if you have not already
done so.


---++ Getting the sources

With GIT installed, you can clone the repository from one of the
addresses below.

    * https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/swipl.git

The development version is kept in its own repository at

    * https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/swipl-devel.git

Use these commands to clone to a new directory =|./swipl-devel|=

The *|./prepare|* script will fetch some required submodules.


==
% git clone https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/swipl-devel.git
% cd swipl-devel
% ./prepare
==

This script also runs on Windows using the bash-shell that comes
with =msysGit=.


Next, consult the file INSTALL for further instructions for installing
SWI-Prolog from source.


You can update to the latest version using the
following commands from the toplevel directory:

==
% make distclean	(typically you can ignore errors)
% git pull
% ./prepare
% ./build
==
